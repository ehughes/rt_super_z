Overview
========
The uart_interrupt_ring_buffer example shows how to use uart driver in interrupt way with
RX ring buffer enabled:

In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board.

Note: The example echo every 8 characters, so input 8 characters every time.



Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- Keil MDK  5.38.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMXRT685-AUD-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J5) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
